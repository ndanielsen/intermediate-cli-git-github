## Purpose

After learning the basics about command-line, git and GitHub are you ready for more? In this [follow up workshop](https://github.com/ndanielsen/intro-cli-git-github), weâ€™re going to dive deeper into the next level on the command line, git and GitHub to give you more understanding and power over your development environment.

In this workshop, we will cover:
- Helpful common commandline tricks and tips
- Git branching and merging strategies
- Common github workflows for team projects

We will start with a quick refresher on using the commandline and git to make sure that everyone is up to speed. 

In the commandline section, we will learn to write basic bash scripts, utilize environmental variables and some other ways to more powerfully utilize the commandline for common operations.

With git, we're going to start with a quick tour of git internals before we jump into git branches, merging and pull remote copies of other teammates code onto our local machine for review. 

As for github, we will learn about team workflows such as trunk based and feature branch models using git and github. We will also look at some tools that github provides to take the pain out of these workflows.
