# Refresher

Let's circle back on some of the basics of the commandline, git and github that are foundation in this workshop. These areas include:

- Forking and clone a github repository
- Navigating via the commandline
- Creating a file via the commandline
- Commit a file in git
- Push new commit to forked repository
- Make pull request to original repository

We're going to be utilizing a sample project throughout the workshop for applied exercises.

Checkout the repo: [Nicecream Icecream - Los Angeles's Finest Hipster Icecream Startup](https://github.com/ndanielsen/nicecream.github.io)

The goal of this Los Angeles based fictional startup is to provide hip people of all ages with the latest ice-cool flavors. You can tell all your friends that you tasted it first here.


### Exercise

- Fork the [Nicecream Icecream Repository](https://github.com/ndanielsen/nicecream.github.io)
- Clone it locally to your machine
- Add a new hip flavor (txt file) in `/flavors`
- Add and commit it to `git` on your machine 
- Push it up to your forked repository
- Make a PR into the main repository

Lastly, clone this repository.
