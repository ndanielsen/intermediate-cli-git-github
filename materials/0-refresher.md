# Refresher

Let's refresh on some of the basics of the commandline, git and github. These areas include:

- Fork and clone a github repository
- Navigating via the commandline
- Creating a file via the commandline
- Commit the file in git
- Push new commit to forked repository
- Make pull request to original repository

We're going to be utilizing a sample project throughout the workshop for applied exercises.

Checkout the repo: [Nicecream Icecream - Los Angeles's Finest Hipster Icecream Startup](https://github.com/ndanielsen/nicecream.github.io)

The goal of this startup is to provide hip people of all ages with the latest ice-cool flavors. You can tell all your friends that you tasted it first.


### Exercise

- Fork the [Nicecream Icecream Repository](https://github.com/ndanielsen/nicecream.github.io)
- Clone it locally to your machine
- Add a new hip flavor (txt file) in `/flavors`
- Add and commit it to git on your machine 
- Push it up to your forked repository
- Make a PR into the main repository
