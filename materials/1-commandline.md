# Commandline and Your Environment

For advanced commandline documentation and exercises please checkout [this page](

## Environmental Variables

Environment variables (ENVs) contain information about your login session, stored for the system shell (terminal) to use when executing commands. They exist whether youâ€™re using Linux, Mac, or Windows. Many of these variables are set by default during installation or user creation.

ENVs are helpful because they allow you to separate code/ logic from configuration. 

ProTip - Checkout this reading from the Twelve Factor about on [configuration](https://12factor.net/config).


### Accessing Current ENVs

Let's find the home directory on our machine:

```

$ echo $HOME

```

This is the user's home directory. Variables have a `$` in front of them.

### Let's Look at All of them

```

$ echo env

```


These are all of the ENVs for your user. It is a lot of information. We can scroll through it slowly using the pipe operator and `less`. 

```

$ echo env | less

```


Hint: You can press the `q` button to escape.


### Setting Envs - Temporary

Sometimes it is helpful to temporary setting ENVs for a program that is running or a short lived process. 

We can temporarily set them for user in our programs with `export` before them in a KEY=VALUE format.

```

$ export MY_NAME=Nathan
$ export FULL_NAME="Nathan Danielsen"

$ echo $MY_NAME
$ echo $FULL_NAME

```


You can also add an ENV before you run a script.

```

$ FRIEND_NAME="Bonnie Wolfe" bash scripts/shoutout.sh

```


#### EXERCISES:

Set these ENVs in your terminal and then print them back.

1) `HACK4LA` with value of "rocks"


2) `LOS_ANGELES` with value of "Has the best icecream!"


#### BONUS EXERCISE:

Modify the `shoutout.sh` to say something nice about someone who you admire using one or more ENVs.

Can you run it?


### Setting Envs - Permament

You can set your own persistent environment variables in your shell (terminal) configuration file, the most common of which for macs is `~/.bash_profile` or in linux is `~/.bashrc`.


This is how you can view it on a mac:

```

$ cat ~/.bash_profile

```


We're not going to configure anything in the `bash_profile` today. It is risky to do in a workshop setting.

Likely, editing it will require the use of `sudo`. 

Check out [`4-Command-Line-Advanced.md`](https://github.com/ndanielsen/intro-cli-git-github/blob/master/materials/4-Command-Line-Advanced.md) for details on the use of `sudo`.


## Bash Scripts

Bash scripts can be used for various purposes, such as executing a shell command, running multiple commands together, customizing administrative tasks, performing task automation etc.

### Running a simple script

We can run a simple bash script like this. 

```
$ bash scripts/hello_class.sh

```

### Shebang

The first line on a bash script to tell the computer what interpreter (computer language / runtime) should execute the script.

Look in `scripts/` for working examples.

Examples:

### Bash (terminal)

script: `./scripts/hello_class.sh`

file contents:
```

#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello class!"

```

### Python (programming language / runtime)

You might not have python3 installed on your computer.

script: `./scripts/hello_world.py`

```

#!/usr/bin/env python3

print('hello world!')

```

## Make script executable by your computer

We can only run files on our computers that have the correct permissions. 

`chmod` modifies the permissions of the file specified by the file name to the permissions specified by permissions.

To make these two scripts executable by everyone, I had to run:

```

$ chmod 777 scripts/hello_class.sh
$ chmod 777 scripts/hello_world.py

```


The first 7 sets the permissions for the user, the second 7 sets the permissions for the group, and the third 7 sets the permissions for everybody else.

```
Permissions:
    7, rwx, read, write, and execute
    6, rw-, read and write
    5, r-x, read and execute
    4, r--, read-only
    3, -wx, write and execute
    2, -w-, write only
    1, --x, execute only
    0, ---, none
```

### Exercise

Create a script to create a `my_blog` project. The script should:

Create a folder called `my_blog`

Inside of that folder:
- Create a README.md file
- Create an index.html file
- Create a `posts/` folder
- Inside of `posts/` create a file  `civic_hacking_is_cool.txt`
- Inside of `posts/` create a file  `hack4la_dtla_is_great.txt`
- Inside of `posts/` create a file  `los_angeles_best_icecream.txt`


Bonus:

Create the README.md with some content aready inside of it.

example:

`echo 'Hello, world.' > Newfile.txt`
