# Commandline and Your Environment

For advanced commandline documentation and exercises please checkout (this page)[

## Environmental Variables

Environment variables (ENVs) contain information about your login session, stored for the system shell (terminal) to use when executing commands. They exist whether youâ€™re using Linux, Mac, or Windows. Many of these variables are set by default during installation or user creation.

ENVs are helpful because they allow you to separate code/ logic from configuration. 

Checkout this chapter reading from the Twelve Factor about on [configuration](https://12factor.net/config).


### Accessing Current ENVs

Let's find the home directory on our machine:

>$ echo $HOME

This is the user's home directory. Variables have the $ in front of them.

### Let's Look at All of them

>$ echo env


That's alot of information. Let's scroll through it slowly using the pipe operator and `less`. 

>$ echo env | less


Hint: You can press the `q` button to escape.


### Setting Envs - Temporary

We can temporarily set them for user in our programs like this:

>$ export MY_NAME=Nathan
>$ export FULL_NAME="Nathan Danielsen"

You can also add it before you run a script.

>$ FRIEND_NAME="Bonnie Wolfe" bash script/shoutout.sh



#### EXERCISES:

1) Set a these ENVs in your terminal and then print them back.

- HACK4LA=rocks
- LOS_ANGELES="Has the best icecream!"

2) Bonus: Modify the `shoutout.sh` to say something nice about someone who you admire using one or more ENVs.


### Setting Envs - Permament

You can set your own persistent environment variables in your shell (terminal) configuration file, the most common of which for macs is `~/.bash_profile` or in linux is `~/.bashrc`.


This is how you can view it on a mac:

>
>$ cat ~/.bash_profile
>

We're not going to configure anything in it today. It is risky to do in a workshop setting.

Likely, editing it will require the use of `sudo`. Check out the (`4-Command-Line-Advanced.md`)[https://github.com/ndanielsen/intro-cli-git-github/blob/master/materials/4-Command-Line-Advanced.md] for details on the use of `sudo`.

Please don't make changes during the workshop as I likely won't have time to fix your computer if you mess it up.


## Bash Scripts

Bash scripts can be used for various purposes, such as executing a shell command, running multiple commands together, customizing administrative tasks, performing task automation etc.

## Shebang

The first line on a bash script to tell the computer what interpreter (computer language / runtime) should execute the script with telling it which one.

Look in `scripts/` for working examples.

Examples:

### Bash (terminal)

script:
./scripts/hello_class.sh

file contents:
> #!/bin/bash
>
> echo "Hello class!"


script:
./scripts/hello_world.py

### Python (programming language / runtime)

> #!/usr/bin/env python3
>
> echo "Hello world!"


### Exercise

- Try to run these scripts on your computer.
- Bonus can you figure out the file permissions on those files?


## Make script executable (runnable) by your computer

We can only run files on our computers that have the correct permissions. 

`chmod` modifies the permissions of the file specified by file name to the permissions specified by permissions.

To make these two scripts executable by everyone, we need to run:

> chmod 777 scripts/hello_class.sh
> chmod 777 scripts/hello_world.py


The first 7 sets the permissions for the user, the second 7 sets the permissions for the group, and the third 7 sets the permissions for everybody else.


Permissions:
    7, rwx, read, write, and execute
    6, rw-, read and write
    5, r-x, read and execute
    4, r--, read-only
    3, -wx, write and execute
    2, -w-, write only
    1, --x, execute only
    0, ---, none
