# Github - Bonus

Now that you've made the icecream startup successful with your development prowess, you have decided to start your own Gelato startup.

Let's use the `index.html` to create your own landing page on github.

At this point, you should have forked and cloned to your local machine the github respository [Nicecream Icecream - Los Angeles's Finest Hipster Icecream Startup](https://github.com/ndanielsen/nicecream.github.io)

# Exercise

- Create a new github project with your username in this pattern: {username.github.io}

- Push up these project files to it.

- Check our your new landing page.
